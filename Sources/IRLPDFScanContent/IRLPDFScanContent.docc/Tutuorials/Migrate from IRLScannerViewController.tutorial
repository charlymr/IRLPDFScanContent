    @Intro(title: "From IRLPDFScanContent to IRLPDFScanContent") {
        We will see how we can migrate from [IRLScannerViewController](https://github.com/charlymr/IRLDocumentScanner)
        1. Change your Dependencies ([README](https://github.com/charlymr/IRLPDFScanContent) on github)
        2. Handle the key `NSCameraUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist`
        3. Update the ViewController from Demo app in [IRLScannerViewController](https://github.com/charlymr/IRLDocumentScanner)
        3. Use the new ``IRLPDFScanContent/IRLPDFScanContent`` class
        4. Handle the ``IRLPDFScanContent/IRLPDFScanContent/delegate`` call back
        
        📚 See also: ``IRLPDFScanContent/IRLPDFScanContent`` &  ``IRLPDFScanContent/IRLPDFScanContentProtocol`` for more details.

    @Section(title: "Update your Info.plist") {
        @ContentAndMedia {            
            If you were using [IRLScannerViewController](https://github.com/charlymr/IRLDocumentScanner), normally you should already have this setup.
            
            Just in case, here is a reminder.
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Open you `Info.plist` or go to `YourProject`/ `YourTarget` / `Info`
                @Code(name: "Info.plist", file: 00-Info.plist) 
            }
            @Step {
                
                ⚠️ As of iOS 10, you must povide a reason for using the camera in you Info.plist:
                Please add the following to your plist:
                **[NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) : Use to scan**

                @Code(name: "Info.plist", file: 01-Info.plist) 
            }
        }
    }
    

    @Section(title: "Convert an Existing ViewController") {
        @ContentAndMedia {            
            You will need to replace your dependendy, for example with Cocoapods:
            
            `pod 'IRLPDFScanContent'` 

             `pod 'IRLPDFScanContent', '~> 1.1'`
      
            There are several option, check the [README](https://github.com/charlymr/IRLPDFScanContent) on github
        }
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                📱 Let's start with the `ViewController` from the [IRLScannerViewController](https://github.com/charlymr/IRLDocumentScanner) Demo.
                
                ✅ Make sure you added the dependency to your project, see **Essentials / Getting Started**  for more details
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-1.swift)
            }
            @Step {
                📚 First replace the import by `import` ``IRLPDFScanContent`` 
                
                ⚠️ If you build & run, your code should work. But you will see alot of Depreciation warning. Let's fix that
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-2.swift)
            }
            @Step {
                🗺 Now we will replace the delegate to ``IRLPDFScanContent/IRLPDFScanContentProtocol``
                
                🧹 Let's clean up unecessary code too, from the Old Delegate
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-3.swift)
            }
            @Step {
                ⚠️ The protocol ``IRLPDFScanContent/IRLPDFScanContentProtocol`` require 2 methods, & we don't need to dissmiss the controller anymore.
                
                👉 Let's get the first image 
                ℹ️ The new scanner support multiple images if you need
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-4.swift)
            }
            @Step {
                💡 Let's extract the first image
                
                👉 We also need to implement the second method to handle `Error`
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-5.swift)
            }
            @Step {
                🪄 Let's add our new Scanner
                
                💾 We can reuse it, and access it multiple time by simply using a `let` in our class (or struct) it's ready to go!
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-6.swift)
            }
            @Step {
                👏 Now it's just a matter of presenting it!
                
                ⚠️ One last thing, ,ake sure you set the Delegate

                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-7.swift)
            }
            @Step {                
                🛠 Build & Run! ⚠️ Make sure you run it on a Device! 📲
                
                @Code(name: "ViewController.swift", file: Migration-FINAL.swift)
            }
        }
    }
}
