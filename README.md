## [Getting started](https://irlpdfscancontent.irlmobile.com) 

IRLPDFScanContent is a convenient way to use PDFKit in SwiftUI allowing the user to scan multiple pages and creating a PDF for you.
This tutorial guides you through building adding this functionality to a SwiftUI view. You will learn to build the view and hanlde the user input.

Chech the documentation (Essentials / Getting Started) here: [Documentation](https://irlpdfscancontent.irlmobile.com/tutorials/tutorial-table-of-contents)

#### Make it availble globaly

- In your `AppDelegate` or your Module, use `@_exported` for convenience
```swift
@_exported import IRLPDFScanContent
```

### Perfrom a Scan

- Initiate the object with [`init(with:)`](https://irlpdfscancontent.irlmobile.com) (You may pass a delegate (`IRLPDFScanContentProtocol`) or observe changes
- present you view [`present(animated:completion:)`](https://irlpdfscancontent.irlmobile.com) or [`await present(animated:)`](https://irlpdfscancontent.irlmobile.com) (iOS 15.0+)
- Observe the result of [`latestScan`](https://irlpdfscancontent.irlmobile.com) or wait for `delegate` if you used the delegate method
- Generate a PDF using [`generatePDF(with:)`](https://irlpdfscancontent.irlmobile.com) or get images using `scanImages`

``` swift
let scanner = IRLPDFScanContent(with: self)
scanner.present(animated: true, completion: nil)

// .... Later stage
guard let pdfURL = scanner.generatePDF(with: "myscan.pdf") else {
    return
}
```
